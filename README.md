Repository for the Citiloco Android app

Citiloco is a mobile application designed to help you plan for a trip in a town where you don't know what to do.

Using a PHP backend with a GNU MathProg optimization engine, Citiloco will decide where you should go.

Citiloco was written on April 6th and 7th of 2013 for the Notre Dame Startup Weekend, and won first prize.

This repository is for the Android app, written by Shane McQuillan and Alex Toombs.
Jeff Kantor and Ed Smilde wrote the backend, currently not hosted.

This code isn't necessarily open source, but feel free to look around.
